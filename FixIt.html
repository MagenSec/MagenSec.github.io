  <h1>Why Fixing Vulnerabilities Matters</h1>

  <p>Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws that attackers can use to gain unauthorized access, steal information, or disrupt your system. Even trusted, widely used applications can have vulnerabilities — and if left unfixed, they can become entry points for cyberattacks.</p>

  <h2>How Attackers Exploit Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <p>Attackers (also known as adversaries) look for known vulnerabilities in outdated software. When they find one, they can often:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Run malicious code without your knowledge</li>
    <li>Steal sensitive data, passwords, or personal files</li>
    <li>Install ransomware or spyware</li>
    <li>Use your system to attack others (turning it into a "bot")</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Even if exploitation is technically difficult,</strong> determined attackers, especially those with financial, political, or criminal motivations, often succeed — especially if the vulnerability has not been fixed.
  </div>

  <h2>What Makes a Vulnerability Dangerous?</h2>
  <p>Security experts rate vulnerabilities based on two key factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Exploitability:</strong> How easy it is to take advantage of the flaw</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The potential damage if the flaw is exploited</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some vulnerabilities are hard to exploit — but the impact (like complete system compromise or data theft) can be severe. That's why even “hard” vulnerabilities shouldn't be ignored.</p>

  <h2>Why You Should Act Quickly</h2>
  <p>Once a vulnerability becomes public, attackers around the world can start developing or sharing exploits for it. The longer it's unpatched on your system, the greater the risk.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    Fixing vulnerabilities quickly is one of the most effective ways to protect your system and data. Prevention is always better than cure.
